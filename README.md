# Introduction

Are you tired of your old and dirty analog music hardware? <br>
Tired of connecting modular synthesizers with actual PHYSICAL cables? <br>
Have you always dreamed of creating those mesmerizing berlin-techno hits of the 70's?<br>

# Motive
<a href="https://megaemce.github.io/mobbler/"><img src="/img/mobbler_word.svg" height="14px"/></a> is a complex extension of [web audio playground](https://github.com/cwilso/WebAudio). It allows you to explore most of [web audio API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) options and play with them in easy to handle visual format. Moreover user can manipulate any module's parameters with other modules thus opening option for custom effects creation without any programming knowledge. Program also contains few popular effects and tutorials on how those could be created from basic modules. It can be used for music creation, education or just for fun. 

# Technology & limitation
Made in vanilla JavaScript as my first big project to get thorough knowledge of this language.<br>
Due to the mouse-related handlers solution doesn't work properly with touch (mobiles/tablets). <br>
It was developed for Chrome browser however seems to be working fine on Firefox and Egde too.

I would never create this solution without the help of these people:
- [Matt McKegg](https://github.com/mmckegg) - author of amazing [web-audio-school](http://mmckegg.github.io/web-audio-school/)
- [Chris Wilson](https://github.com/cwilso) - webAudioAPI guru with his amazing tutorials (just [one example](https://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/2013/06/17/synthesis-web-audio-api-envelopes.html))
- [Sam Bellen](https://github.com/Sambego) - role model for proper multiAudioNode handling and one of the first who started the fire
- [Oskar Eriksson](https://github.com/Theodeus) - creator of Tuna.js
- [Tero Parviainen](https://github.com/teropa) - creator of amazing webAudioAPI [tutorials](https://teropa.info/blog/2016/08/19/what-is-the-web-audio-api.html)
